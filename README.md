<h3> My in interestIT ?</h3> 
<p><h5>What is your interested in IT and when did it start?</h5></p>

</P>Well my interest and fascination started at a young age through gaming. So, from there my interest increased as I had an old PC and I often had to upgrade parts specifically the graphic card which led me to often research more and more regarding IT. As game developed from being a solo played game to being a more connected platform for individuals to communicate with each other. Then came the advancement of mobile phones from being a simple device which only allows call and text to a device which allows you to do most your work that where once done by a computer. so, these factors played a huge part in my interest in IT, I personally love that technology will not stop but will keep on advancing so it will play a huge part of my life. I love how it make our life so much easier in many aspects of our life such as communications, tracking, logistics, organizing, entertainment and construction there is no field that has not taken benefits from advancement of technology.<P>

<h3><p>Do you have any IT experience?</p></h3>

I don’t have any official experience in this field beside the 2 years I took in high school which taught the bare basics of IT. I have learned many programs online such as CS6 (illustrator, photoshop, InDesign) but nothing official. I want to learn in more details the many fields of IT so that I might have a good detail in which field I want to excel in within the IT department.

<h3><p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p></h3>

I choose to come to RMIT honestly because I was advised by a agent from open university because it was the best option for me. I don’t have my ATAR and I want to continue my education while working so this course was online and fit my criteria.

<h3><p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3></p>

<p>Well I expect to learn the basics of the many fields within the IT department which will give me a sound knowledge of which field I want to excel in for future studies. I expect to learn many things regarding the many fields within IT but not be an expert in any specific field. For example, when I have completed my studies, I could explain any of the subject to a layman with him thinking I am very educated within the field but while in the company of a software engineer, I would most likely have the bare minimum knowledge of software development. So yes, I will have knowledge compared to those with have not studied this field but would not have excel in a specific field.</p>
